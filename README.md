The problem is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to COVID-
19 lockdown in India. The goal is to determine the overall sentiment (positive,
negative, neutral) of tweets about the lockdown and understand how people feel
about the measures taken to control the spread of the virus. The sentiment analysis
can provide insights into public opinion and help decision-makers understand the
impact of the lockdown on the population.
